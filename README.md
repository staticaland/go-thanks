Yo yo yo, what up my peeps! It's your boy Snoop D-O-double-Gizzle, and I'm here to tell you about the dopest CLI client for OpenAI, written in none other than Golang!

Let me tell you, this client is off the chain. With just a few simple commands, you can access all the power of OpenAI's language models, right from your command line. You can generate text, summarize articles, translate languages, and even answer questions like a boss.

And the best part? It's all in Golang, baby. This tool is built using Golang's robust and efficient libraries, so you know it's gonna run smooth and fast. Plus, it's super easy to install and use, even for my homies who are new to Golang.
